Combine the sorting assignment in Assignment #4 with the Control Break problem described in class to make a complete solution.  Provided is just the first version control break (cbreak0-1.cpp) that performs the bare minimum output.  For this assignment, you will have responsibility to provide everything.

Using the I/O routines (read/write) and (any) of the sort routines as a guide, create a single program that reads in an unordered list of bookentry elements into a sufficiently large enough array.

Use the command line (like Assignment #4) to specify the input file.

Use one of your sort routines (that you wrote and submitted to Assignment #4) to put the bookentry records in sorted order by the item.

Call your control break function to produce a report with the appropriate control breaks (subtotals and grand total) on the standard output.

Use the timing routines describe in the Tip-of-the-Day (3-31) to time:
	time it takes to perform the sort
	time it takes to produce the control break report <- skip this! too short to measure
	the overall time it takes to run the application
	
In addition to the program files, also include a report (in PDF) that

	Describes how to compile your program and run it.
	Any test files you would like to share that demonstrates your program.
	And an analysis (Big-Oh) of the the two main components of your application (sorting and 		reporting).
	
On this assignment, you have the freedom to use your own names for files but you need to include instructions on how to compile your program.  As in assignment #4, you need to get the input file from the command line.
