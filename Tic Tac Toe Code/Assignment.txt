The basic display code (shown in class) is here: tictactoe.cpp

In no particular order, add the following functionality:

convert into a C++ class
allow the user to enter a "row col" on the console (keyboard) and redraw the screen
add a computer player that
    allows the user to go first
    always goes for the win, if available in one move
  always blocks the user if they are about to win in the next move
comment the code :-)
