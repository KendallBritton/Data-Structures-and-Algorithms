Problem 1.

Draw a trapezoid with asterisks.  The trapezoid has a triangle on top,  a square, and a triangle on the bottom.  The size is input from the standard input (cin).  Note the angles in the sample output. 

Problem 2.

For this problem, you need to compile a histogram of grades.  The input grade data is hard-coded in the template file (the global variable int data ).  Use this template code to start with.  The output should look like this.

In both cases, don't add any additional cout's except those required to produce the desired output; i.e. remove any debugging code you have added.
